# Shelter Animals
Machine Learning project

# Task
We want to create a model that will predict a shelter animal's outcome given information about it. More specifically, we are using data from Austin's animal center from Oct 2013 -> Mar 2016 that give the status of dogs and cats as they leave the animal shelter.

#Data Description
The statuses of animals upon exit include: Adoption, Death, Euthanasia, Returned to owner, and transfer to a different facility.

The features present in the data include: dog/cat breed, fur color, spayed vs. intact, gender, and age upon exit of the shelter.
